## Inspiration
Procrastination stressing always?
Tired of reading self help books but not translating it to actions?

Been our life story too and so we built a solution which practically worked for us!

## What it does
It translates mental/psychological blocks into physical aspect through real monetary values. If a person will miss a deadline, they will lose money. Hence, keeping you accountable and motivated to achieve aim on time powered by our AI model usage.

## How we built it
We used MERN stack, taking advantage of React Native along with Expo to code once but deploy at all the platforms in once to make the app universally available for the ease of access.

## Challenges we ran into
Design to make it simpler and intuitive.
As it involved lots of javascript libraries and dependency, so versioning for them during integration. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We overcame all the challenges one by one. Pulling an all nighter really did a big help there and were able to built core functionality we thought of within a day.

## What we learned
We learnt the importance of diving tasks and integrating them.

## What's next for NowYesNow
Iterate it after reviews and keep on improving.
